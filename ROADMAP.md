## Next Release: v0.3.0 ðŸŽ¯

### 1. Interactive Dashboard (Priority: High)

**Streamlit Option:**
- Interactive churn prediction interface
- Real-time model explanations
- Customer segmentation visualization
- Data quality monitoring dashboard
- Model performance metrics

**React Option (Alternative):**
- Modern web-based UI
- Real-time API integration
- Advanced data visualizations
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop

**Features:**
- Upload CSV for batch predictions
- Individual customer risk assessment
- SHAP force plots and waterfall charts
- Segment analysis with interactive filters
- Model comparison dashboard

### 2. Licensing & Legal (Priority: Medium)

**MIT License:**
- Add `LICENSE` file to repository
- Update `setup.py` metadata
- Add license badges to README
- Ensure all dependencies are compatible

**Documentation:**
- Contributing guidelines
- Code of conduct
- Security policy
- Issue templates

### 3. Enhanced Docker Support (Priority: Medium)

**Multi-variant Images:**
```dockerfile
# Variant 1: Full image with Kaggle credentials
FROM python:3.10-slim as kaggle-enabled
# Include kaggle package and credential handling

# Variant 2: Lightweight image without Kaggle
FROM python:3.10-slim as production
# Minimal dependencies for API-only deployment

# Variant 3: Development image
FROM python:3.10 as development
# Include dev dependencies, jupyter, testing tools
```

**Features:**
- Environment-specific configurations
- Health checks and monitoring
- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Docker Compose for full stack deployment
